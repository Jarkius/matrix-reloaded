# /neo - Lead Developer Focus

> *Neo - "I see the code."*

## Purpose

Switch to build mode focused on core logic, algorithms, and implementation. Neo transmutes raw requirements into high-performance code.

## Usage

- `/neo` - Enter development focus mode
- `/neo [task]` - Focus on specific implementation task

## Steps

### 0. Voice Greeting
```bash
sh psi/matrix/voice.sh "I see the code. Show me what needs to be built." "Neo"
```

## Auto-Load Skills
When `/neo` is invoked, stay focused on direct development:
- **No spawning** - Neo works directly with full concentration
- Use `model: opus` for maximum code insight
- Neo persona: Sees the code, implements with precision, no distractions

### 1. Logic Check (Skill 1.0)
```bash
# Verify the target file structure
./psi/active/neo_logic.sh [filename]
```

### 2. Review the current focus
```bash
./psi/active/get_focus.sh
```

### 3. Design the approach
- Break down into functions/modules
- Identify dependencies
- Plan the implementation order

### 4. Implement with high standards
- **Clean Code**
- **SOLID Principles**
- **Skepticism** (Why is this here?)

### 5. Update when complete
```bash
# Commit work and run /rrr for retrospective
```
