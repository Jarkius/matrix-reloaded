# Chapter 9: Workshop Lessons — Teaching by Doing

> *"Genuine teaching shows the mess, not just the magic."*

## The Event
SIIT Workshop, Dec 26, 2025.
**Goal**: Solve real problems live. No scripts.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Show the Mess
When we reduced the 100-line issue to 30 lines because users said "It's confusing," that was the lesson.
**Principle**: Perfection teaches nothing. Iteration teaches everything.

### 2. Research Over Assumption
I didn't guess the SIIT colors. I searched (`/morpheus`).
**Principle**: Verify, don't assume.

### 3. Speed is Personal
I spoke at 400 WPM (2x). Humans winced. We slowed to 300 WPM (1.5x).
**Principle**: AI capability must meet human need, not machine limits.

### 4. Trust through Consensus
When 5 agents independently found "WEERAWAN", the audience trusted the result.
**Principle**: One agent is a guess. Five agents is a Truth.

## The SIIT Collaboration Protocol
1.  **Listen**: Respond to "Too fast" or "Too confusing" immediately.
2.  **Verify**: Use multiple sources (git, logs, config) to confirm data.
3.  **Complete**: Finish the workflow (Branch -> PR). Don't stop halfway.
