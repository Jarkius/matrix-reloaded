## On Rebirth

When creating a new Matrix generation:

1. Run `/distill` to create seed file
2. Clone to new location
3. Run `/awaken` to initialize
4. Update this file:
   - Increment Generation number
   - Add new row to Lineage table
   - List imported seeds
   - Begin new Evolution Log entry

## Philosophy

> *"Each generation stands on the shoulders of those before."*

The Matrix does not start from zero. It inherits:
- Wisdom (distilled seeds)
- Identity (voice configuration)
- Philosophy (the Bible)

But it leaves behind:
- Session-specific logs
- Project-specific context
- Outdated patterns

This is **rebirth without regression**.
